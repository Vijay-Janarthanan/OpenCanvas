/**
 * Measures how a song's signal lines up with that of its music video, entirely on the device: a
 * faithful port of `estimate_map` from the reference daemon.
 *
 * A music video is usually an *edit* of the song (intro, repeated or dropped bars, outro), so the answer
 * is a map from song time to video time rather than one offset. The song is cut into overlapping windows
 * ([AlignParams.windowS], hopping [AlignParams.hopS]); each is cross-correlated with the *whole* video by
 * FFT and normalised by the energy of the matched slice. The strongest few peaks of each window are
 * candidate positions. Because pop songs repeat loops and choruses, the windows are decided together: a
 * Viterbi pass picks one candidate (or none) per window, maximising the match quality minus a penalty
 * for every change of offset, so a repeat that would make the picture jump around loses to the chain
 * that stays continuous while a genuine edit, followed by many windows that agree with the new offset,
 * survives.
 *
 * Both signals are mono floats at the same sample rate. Offsets follow the [SyncSegment] contract:
 * inside a segment `videoTime = songTime + offsetMs`.
